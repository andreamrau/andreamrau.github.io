      <description>tl;dr: Use I() to treat a numeric variable in a data.frame “as is” and avoid unintended conversion when mapping to transparency in a ggplot2 aesthetic. Today I ran into a ggplot2 plotting problem involving mapping the transparency aesthetic to a numeric variable – this drove me crazy until I figured it out.

      <description>I recently decided that I wanted to move my professional homepage from a free page set up on WordPress to GitHub Pages using blogdown by Yihui Xi.
There were basically two reasons for this: (1) Because I only sprang for the free WordPress site, there are gigantic, ugly ads that appear on every single page. I only recently realized this as I was usually viewing my WordPress site while being logged on – and apparently, the ads only appear for other people.</description>
