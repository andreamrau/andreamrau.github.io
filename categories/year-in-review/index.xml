      <description>Well, here I am again, exactly one year after my last year-in-review post (apparently January 3 is peak procastination time when returning from the holiday break?).
The past year represented a whirlwind of change for me and my family. In the first half of 2019, I wrapped up the final few months of my AgreenSkills+ sabbatical stay as a Visiting Scholar at UWM in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. My time at UWM was exciting, rich in new and continued collaborations, and a wonderful way to expand my research horizons while delving into the world of genomics applied to human health.</description>

      <description>The start of a new year is always a nice time to look back and take stock of the past year, and look forward and set some goals for the coming year. I spent the entirety of 2018 as an AgreenSkills+ Visiting Scholar at UWM in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which has been (and continues to be!) a very rich experience that has given me the chance to broaden my understanding of statistical genetics and genomics and expand my skill set.</description>
